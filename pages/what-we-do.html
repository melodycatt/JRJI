                <div class="title">Healing</div>
                Since 2009, JRJI has been leading restorative justice spiritual retreats in California state prisons and juvenile halls, using Ignatian meditation to inspire transformation. Through meditations rooted in the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola, we help incarcerated individuals encounter God’s presence in their lives. This prayerful practice engages the imagination by involving the senses—taste, touch, sight, smell, and hearing—to reflect on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. By embracing the love of Jesus, participants find a pathway to healing and renewal. Our ongoing visits to these facilities are essential, fostering relationships with these growing, spiritually vibrant, and monastic-like communities.

                JRJI runs a support group for those who have been previously incarcerated and are trying to integrate themselves back into society. Many of those in the group are people who were once JRJI participants in prison.

                <div class="title">Advocacy</div>
                The Jesuit Restorative Justice Initiative (JRJI) has been a key collaborator in the successful passage of California Senate Bills 9, 260, and 261. These laws provide juveniles serving life sentences or longer with the opportunity for eventual review before a parole board. During numerous visits to Sacramento, Fr. Mike Kennedy, along with JRJI staff and volunteers, brought a unique perspective to the state legislature by sharing the real-life stories and experiences of individuals impacted by the justice system.
                <br><br>JRJI’s long-term commitment to supporting young inmates transitioning into the adult penal system allows us to highlight the significant developmental changes these individuals undergo as they mature into adulthood. This insight positions us as valuable partners alongside lawyers, advocates, and other stakeholders working to address the harsh and unjust treatment of children in the justice system. Our efforts continue as we join coalitions to challenge visitation restrictions for undocumented parents and oppose direct file laws that allow juveniles to be tried as adults.

                <div class="subtitle">LEGISLATION JRJI SUPPORTED:</div>
                <strong>SENATE BILL 1391: JUVENILES: FITNESS FOR JUVENILE COURT (2017-2018)</strong><br>
                Introduced by Senators Lara and Mitchell<br>
                This bill would repeal the authority of a district attorney to make a motion to transfer a minor from juvenile court to a court of criminal jurisdiction in a case in which a minor is alleged to have committed a specified severe offense when he or she was 14 or 15 years of age, thereby amending Proposition 57. By increasing the number of minors retained under the juvenile court’s jurisdiction, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Read more about this bill here.<br><br>

                <strong>SENATE BILL 1437: ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY FOR FELONY MURDER (2017-2018)</strong><br>
                Introduced by Senators Skinner and Anderson<br>
                This bill would prohibit a participant in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of one of the specified first-degree murder felonies in which a death occurs from being liable for murder unless the person was the actual killer or the person was not the actual killer but, with the intent to kill, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer, or the person was a significant participant in the underlying felony and acted with reckless indifference to human life. Read more about this bill here.

                <div class="title">Education</div>
                The Jesuit Restorative Justice Initiative (JRJI) is dedicated to inspiring incarcerated individuals—both young and adult—as well as their families and the families of victims, to embrace education as a pathway to healing and reintegration into society. Education serves as a core pillar of the apostolic work we are cultivating within detention facilities, encompassing three interconnected dimensions that seamlessly support and strengthen one another.<br><br><br>
                <div class="subtitle">FIRST DIMENSION: THE INCARCERATED</div>
                Education plays a crucial role in the monthly spiritual retreats held in state prisons and juvenile halls across California and other states. These retreats, lasting either a full or half day, help participants deepen their self-awareness and understanding of their relationships with loved ones and those around them, guided by an enriched knowledge of the Gospel.<br><br>
                During these retreats, young men and women are introduced to Gospel-based meditations rooted in the Ignatian tradition of contemplation, developed by Saint Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus. A key resource in this practice is Rev. Michael Kennedy’s Jesus the Risen Prisoner: An Invitation to Freedom (2008). This book invites participants to connect with Jesus as a prisoner who endured condemnation, a torturous death, and ultimately rose again, embodying hope and freedom. Through Jesus' resurrection, the communities JRJI serves draw strength to navigate life's challenges and find renewed hope where it has been lost.<br><br>
                Retreatants are encouraged to express their deepest needs and wounds through writing and to share their experiences with peers. This process fosters healing by promoting accountability for past and present actions, paving the way for a productive life that begins in prison with participation in educational programs. The bonds formed during these retreats cultivate healing communities within the prison walls, creating spaces of transformation and growth.<br><br><br>
                <div class="subtitle">SECOND DIMENSION: FAMILIES</div>
                Through Gospel-based meditation, parents and family members of both the incarcerated and victims gain insight into the root causes that led to the challenging circumstances their loved ones face in juvenile halls and prisons. JRJI invites these parents—both of incarcerated individuals and victims of crime—to join support groups facilitated by the organization.<br><br>
                In a spirit of loving unity, families come to recognize the unwavering love of a God who walks with them through their grief, guiding them toward healing, growth, and a more fulfilling life. This transformative journey helps them become productive members of society. Moreover, the compassionate presence and support of family members, relatives, or significant others during visits inspire the spiritual and emotional growth of incarcerated individuals, fostering a sense of maturity and hope.<br><br><br>
                <div class="subtitle">THIRD DIMENSION: GENERAL PUBLIC</div>
                Formerly incarcerated youth and adults collaborate with JRJI to share their personal stories in various settings, both faith-based and secular. Through these testimonies, they raise awareness about the prison system and inspire public interest in contributing to restorative justice for those seeking to break free from cycles of victimization.<br><br>
                To inform the public about the efforts of state lawmakers in providing second chances for incarcerated individuals, JRJI members actively engage in spreading awareness about the legislative process. They highlight ongoing discussions about bills in Sacramento and share updates on newly passed laws.<br><br><br>
